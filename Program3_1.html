        <div>Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a trail.</div>

        <div>It is always the simple that produces the marvelous.</div>

        <div>As knowledge increases,wonder deepens</div>

        <p>For beautiful eyes, look for the good in others; for beautiful lips, speak only for kindness; and
            for poise, walk with knowledge that you are never alone</p>

        <p>The best and most beautiful thing in the world cannot be seen or even touched- they must be felt 
            with the heart</p>

        <p>It is during our darkest moments that we must focus to see the light</p>    
        
        <p>happiness is not something you postpone for for the fututre; it is something you design for the
        present</p>

        <p>Be faithful to that which exist within yourself.</p>
