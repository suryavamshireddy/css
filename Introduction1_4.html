        <h1>Introduction to CSS</h1>
        <p> A CSS(Cashcading style sheet) file allows you to separate your web sites
            (X)HTML content from its style. As always you use your (X)HTML file to arrange the
            content, but all of the presentation(fonts,colors,background,borders, text
            formatting, link effects & so on..) are accompalished within a CSS.</p>
